    No matter what has happened to you in the past or what is going on in your
    life right now, it has no power to keep you from having an amazingly good
    future if you will walk by faith in God. God loves you! He wants you to live
    with victory over sin so you can possess His promises for your life today!
  </Section>
  <Section title={'Header Two'}>
    Infuse your life with action. Don't wait for it to happen. Make it happen.
    Make your own future. Make your own hope. Make your own love. And whatever
    your beliefs, honor your creator, not by passively waiting for grace to come
    down from upon high, but by doing what you can to make grace happen...
    yourself, right now, right down here on Earth.
  </Section>
  <Section title={'Header Three'}>
    I believe that a trusting attitude and a patient attitude go hand in hand.
    You see, when you let go and learn to trust God, it releases joy in your
    life. And when you trust God, you're able to be more patient. Patience is
    not just about waiting for something... it's about how you wait, or your
    attitude while waiting.
